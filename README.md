By leveraging the Dio package, this project provides insights into handling common networking tasks such as fetching data, error handling, request cancellation, and more.

### Features

- Simplified HTTP requests using Dio
- Efficient handling of network responses
- Implementation of global configuration settings
- Usage of interceptors for request and response manipulation
- Error handling and debugging strategies
- Demonstrates FormData usage for multipart requests
